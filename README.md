# Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. Education

This project investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the education system in the United States, with a focus on Texas. Using multiple datasets and visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, we analyzed the impact of the pandemic on five key educational metrics:

---

## Hypotheses Explored

1. **Student Mental Health** – Depression, anxiety, therapy usage, and academic impairment among college students.
2. **Attendance Drop Rates** – ADA and WADA data show a significant attendance decline in Texas public schools.
3. **Student Grade Performance** – STAAR performance dropped significantly, especially for Hispanic and Pacific Islander students.
4. **Retention Rates** – High school students experienced a 25% increase in grade-level retention post-pandemic.
5. **Drop-out Rates** – Dropout rates increased in high-poverty areas, but change in poverty did not statistically explain the trend.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Tableau** (for hypotheses 1–5 visual dashboards)
- **Power BI** (hypotheses 2 & 5)
- **Python** & **Pandas** (data cleaning, transformation & merging datasets)
- **Excel** (preprocessing, data cleaning & transformation)
